        <h3> How to make banana bread moist</h3>
        This banana bread is super moist thanks to butter, eggs, and brown sugar (which adds more moisture than white sugar). 
        Plus, mashed bananas have plenty of moisture on their own. Make sure you store the banana bread properly to keep it moist for several days.

        <h3> How long to bake banana-bread</h3>
        This banana bread recipe should be perfectly baked after about an hour in an oven preheated to 350 degrees F.
         You'll know it's done when a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. Make sure you let the bread sit in the pan for about 10 minutes before turning it out.
          Otherwise, it might not stay in one piece.
