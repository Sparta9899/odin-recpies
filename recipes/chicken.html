<h3> Description</h3>
The original plan for this deliciously different hot sandwich was simply going to be a chicken-based version of a pulled pork sandwich.
 But then I remembered I'm not the biggest fan of pulled pork sandwiches, or at least tossing shredded meat in barbecue sauce before serving on a bun.
  That's why I decided to try the sloppy Joe approach â€” and I could not have been happier with the results.

  <p>Above and beyond the great taste and texture, these "sloppy chickens" were incredibly simple to make.
     All we do is dump everything in the saucepan, simmer until tender, and then eat. This is a classic example of a recipe they call "dump recipes," 
     but just because "they" call them that, doesn't mean we have to (and I really hope you don't) </p>
